# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!
As of now, this is not suitable for full-time use. More configs will be added, including propper documentation and dependencies. Feel free to start using this if you feel like it!

> [!NOTE]
> This is the config **I use on my own system**. It is not intended to be used broadwise and, while I try to make everything not break suddenly, some things may not run as expected in your machine.

## Dependencies

For now, the dependencies are [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (I use JetBrains Mono in thi config, you can choose your own, though!)
```
$ dnf install stow git
```

## How to install

Clone the repository in your `$HOME` directory using git
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcioSobel/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles
```
Run GNU Stow to create symlinks
```bash
$ stow .
```
If you get an error, this means some config files already exists in your system. You can ignore them, or backup your files and run the stow command again. You can also override the symlinks in the directory using the `--adopt` argument.

And done! You should be able to log in Hyprland and start using this config. Feel free to remove the `.git` repository, or keep it if you want to create your own repo or update from here!
